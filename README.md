# mp3-player
An mp3 player I made in python using Tkinter for the GUI and pygame for the player itself.
To succesfully run the program, you will need to have Tkinter and Pygame installed using `pip install pygame` and `pip install tkinter`.
It isn't very stylish but the foundation is done and there's always room for improvement.
